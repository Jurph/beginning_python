# beginning_python
This is a collection of scripts I'm writing while learning Python. 
I'm also learning to use GitHub, and Linux from a command line, and 
snort and burp and wireshark ...(okay look I don't actually know what 
I'm doing alright).

2 JUN 15 - edited this file with VIM and used GIT from command line
along with SSH keys generated with 'dropbear' (wtf?) to clone and push
my updates. Not bad.

5 JUN 15 - managed to get my e2 history ported over here using a
combination of 12-year-old Perl, python, and grep.  Going to remove my 
e2 corpus and work from bitbucket instead though.
