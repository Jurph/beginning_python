# beginning_python
This is a collection of scripts I'm writing while learning Python. 
I'm also learning to use GitHub, and Linux from a command line, and 
snort and burp and wireshark ...(okay look I don't actually know what 
I'm doing alright).

# 2 JUN 15 - edited this file with VIM and used GIT from command line
# along with SSH keys generated with 'dropbear' (wtf?) to clone and push
# my updates. Not bad.
